## 🔥 Fire Classification Dataset (A–B–C–K)
### 📌 Overview

This repository contains a fire classification image dataset introduced and used in the paper:

    Deployable AI for Fire Detection and Classification: A YOLOv5n–EfficientNetB0 Approach
The dataset was created to address a gap in fire classification research, where most existing datasets focus only on fire detection (fire vs. non-fire) rather than fire type classification.

### 🎯 Purpose
The dataset is designed for:
- Fire type classification
- Lightweight and deployable AI models
- Research on fire-specific risk assessment

### 🔥 Fire Classes
The dataset is organized into four fire classes, following standard fire categorization:
Class	Label	Description
- **A	Combustibles**	Fires involving solid combustible materials (wood, paper, cloth)
- B	**Flammables**	Fires involving flammable liquids and gases
- C	**Electrical**	Fires caused by electrical equipment
- K	**Cooking**	Fires involving cooking oils and fats
